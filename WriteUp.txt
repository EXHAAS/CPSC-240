Hayden Webb did the File Reader class, File Writer class, Testing, and write up
Anthony Tompkins did the SortNumber, ReadInventory, SearchBikePartList, and SortName classes
Ellie Haas did the EnterSellDisplay, BikePart, and Main class, while doing documentation

We all looked over and tweaked/made edits to eachothers' code from time to time



The files were tested by doing various stress tests, such as unusual unicode character strings,
negative numbers, long inputs, invalid inputs, and duplicated bikeParts.
